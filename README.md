Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. In a login application, the model might include classes that define the user entity, authentication logic, and any data access operations needed to interact with a database or other storage systems.

View: The view is responsible for rendering the user interface. In a login application, views would include the login form where users enter their credentials and any additional pages for registration, password recovery, or account management.

Controller: The controller handles user input and interacts with both the model and the view. It processes requests from the user, such as submitting the login form, and then updates the model (e.g., validates user credentials) and selects the appropriate view to render based on the result.
When a user accesses the login page, the request is routed to the controller's action method responsible for displaying the login form. The controller retrieves any necessary data from the model and passes it to the view, which then renders the HTML for the login form.

When the user submits the form, another action method on the controller processes the form data. The controller then validates the user's credentials, typically by checking them against a database, and determines the appropriate action to take based on the result.

If the credentials are valid, the controller might create a user session to keep the user authenticated and redirect them to a protected area of the application. If the credentials are invalid, the controller would likely re-render the login form with an error message.

Overall, the MVC architecture in a login application helps to separate concerns and keep the code organized, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time.
